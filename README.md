# Getting Started

I recommend using Visual Studio Code. 

If you use a clean install of Visual Studio code and check out the repository you will be prompted to install the relevant extensions to make use of the Notebooks.

You may need to install [PyCryptoDome](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) if you do not already have it installed.

This can be done in the usual way by following these [instructions](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html)].
